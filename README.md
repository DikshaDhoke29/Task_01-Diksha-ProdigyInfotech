Implement Caesar cipher: - Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.
Encryption and Decryption are fundamental processes in cryptography, used to secure information and protect it from unauthorized access.
	Encryption is the process of transforming readable data (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using a mathematical algorithm and a key.
This protects the original data from being understood by unauthorized parties.
•	Purpose: To ensure confidentiality
	Decryption is the process of converting the encrypted data (ciphertext) back into its original readable form (plaintext) using a key.
•	Purpose: To allow authorized users to access the original information.                            
The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and earliest methods of encryption and demonstrates the basic principles of cryptography: substitution and key-based transformation.
Working of Caesar Cipher
Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.
The number of positions to shift is called the key.
Example (with a key of +3):
•	Plaintext: HELLO
•	Ciphertext: KHOOR
